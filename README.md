## 📖 What is expo-stable-id?

expo-stable-id is a tool designed to create and keep a user identifier that works across multiple devices. This means it helps apps recognize users no matter which device they use. It is especially useful for apps built with Expo, a popular system for making mobile apps.

This identifier keeps the same value even if a user switches devices, clears the app data, or logs in from different places. It works by saving the identifier securely using device features like iCloud and Keychain on Apple devices.

You don’t need to know how it works. This guide shows you how to download and use the software easily.
